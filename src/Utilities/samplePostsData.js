My wife knows this very well. It’s hard to even sit next to her after she just smoked. Not to mention she has been “trying” to quit since I did. She will quit long enough to justify making a large purchase since she isn’t buying a pack a day any longer and then start back up after she gets what she wants. \n\nI’m just so flippin pissed about the whole thing and feel so disrespected. I’ve always said she is one of the rudest smokers I’ve ever met, but this crossed a line.",

When I got in my car this morning my car smelled like an ash tray. When Turning on the AC it was all I could do to not gag from the smell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a former smoker, I quit 7 years ago. Ever since then I can not stand the smell of smoke. It makes me want to hurl. My wife knows this very well. It’s hard to even sit next to her after she just smoked. Not to mention she has been “trying” to quit since I did. She will quit long enough to justify making a large purchase since she isn’t buying a pack a day any longer and then start back up after she gets what she wants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m just so flippin pissed about the whole thing and feel so disrespected. I’ve always said she is one of the rudest smokers I’ve ever met, but this crossed a line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
